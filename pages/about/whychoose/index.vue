      Have you ever completed the home loan process and felt ripped off or unsure if you really got a good rate and fair closing costs? Many people do. We’ve talked to hundreds of consumers that have told us that they question their mortgage packages and the “good faith estimate” after closing with other lenders. Consumers say that often costs at the closing are much higher than what they had seen on the good faith estimate. This leaves them feeling frustrated and taken advantage of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rate Rabbit changes all of that by turning the good faith estimate into a guaranteed and protected fixed-fee package. We combine all applicable closing, lender and third-party costs (Refinance Only) into one low, all applicable guaranteed fee. Rate Rabbit is committed to providing its customers with the best mortgage rates and the lowest closing fee in the industry.
