    <h3>How we use your information</h3>
    <p>The information that we collect from you is required in order to process and approve your loan. Information collected from other sources is used to verify the information you provided in the application process. </p>
    <h3>When we don't share your information</h3>
    <p>Rate Rabbit does not sell or share your personal information with third party marketers or anyone who is not involved in your transaction with us. </p>
    <h3>When we do share your information</h3>
    <p>We will disclose your information to third parties only when they are involved in your transaction, on an as-needed basis.

    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use Blue Hornet as our email service provider on our site.  When you sign up for rate alerts or for information on special loan offers we will share your name and email address as necessary for the third party to provide that service.  The only types of emails being sent out other than sign ups would be for those who have entered contact information to confirm a loan application.  These emails are service related emails and users may not opt out of receiving these.</p>
    <p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>
    <h3>How we protect your information </h3>

    <h3>What you can do to help protect your information </h3>
    <li>Keep your account numbers, credit card numbers, personal identification numbers, and passwords in a safe place. Never keep this information with your credit card or somewhere that is easily accessible by others. </li>
    <li>Be cautious when disclosing account numbers, social security number, etc. to others. If someone calls you and explains that the call is from Rate Rabbit and asks for personal information and you are unsure, hang up and contact your loan consultant or loan processor directly. </li>
    <li>Keep your contact information current with us. This will help in the event we notice unusual or potentially fraudulent activity. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by visiting your Rate Rabbit account, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@raterabbit.com">info@raterabbit.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</li>

    <h3>My Rate Rabbit account </h3>
    <p>Your Rate Rabbit account will allow you to access information regarding your loan as well as your personal information. You will have a username and password in order to prevent others from accessing your account and using your personal information. Please keep this information in a safe place. </p>
    <h3>When you contact us </h3>
    <p>When you contact us by using forms on our website, your information will be protected by encryption. We will collect information such as your name, email address, phone number, and possibly other types of information. We only use this information to answer questions or to resolve concerns. </p>
    <h3>Protection from impersonation and eavesdropping </h3>
    <p>SSL server authentication allows your browser to confirm a server's identity. This ensures that any sensitive data transferred from you to Rate Rabbit is encrypted using 128 bit technology, so no one is able to catch, read or tamper with your data during the communication process. It also checks the server's certificate and public ID to validate that they have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) listed in the browser's trusted CA's. This provides a very high degree of confidentiality. Rate Rabbit is registered with the GeoTrust to ensure the security of your information.</p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
    <p>We use session ID cookies. We use these to track anonymous user sessions. The cookie expires after a few hours. </p>
    <p>If you reject cookies, users will not be able to get real time quotes. Otherwise they will still be able to view the static portions of the site.</p>
    <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Ninthlink Inc, for www.raterabbit.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
    <h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.</p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <h3>Your transaction with Rate Rabbit is secure</h3>
    <p>Sending data over the Internet can sometimes pose several security issues: eavesdropping and impersonation. We use a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) that protects against both of these risks. SSL has been standard on Internet browsers for several years. If your computer has version 4 or higher of Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer or AOL you have SSL.</p>
    <h3>Why you are safe with Rate Rabbit</h3>
    <p>Anytime sensitive information is sent or received from your computer, Rate Rabbit uses SSL. Our goal is to keep your information safe, secure and private. When you see the Key (Netscape) or Lock (Internet Explorer or AOL) you will know that it really is Rate Rabbit, and not an imposter. You can also be assured that no one else can see or alter your information in transit.</p>
    <h3>Another possible threat </h3>
    <p>Be aware of phishing! Phishing is a term used for a scam where someone sends an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established, legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. If you should ever get an email that you are unsure about, please contact the company using phone numbers listed on their website.</p>
