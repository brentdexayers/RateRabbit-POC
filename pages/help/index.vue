    <h3>
      What makes Rate Rabbit different from other retail and online mortgage lenders?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not only searching Live Rates 24/7 that are transparent, we also make it easy to compare options. Our guarantee of one fixed closing fee or no cost loans are unique.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How do I know I'm getting the best price on my loan closing and not a low ball estimate?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Rate Rabbit provides a GUARANTEE with every loan, not just a good faith estimate. For refinances we guarantee the total cost of your loan, including all lender and third party fees. On purchases we guarantee the lender fees and appraisal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some lenders will often lowball third party costs, which they can't be held to because they are "estimates." Sometimes they even mark up the costs as they see fit and keep the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      These practices usually occur off-line because details on third-party costs typically is not provided until the borrower receives the Good Faith Estimate, and are not given to the borrower until three business days after the lender has received the loan application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rate Rabbit gives you the price quote upfront and takes the "estimate" out of the Good Faith Estimate. One Easy guarantees that you will pay what you see on the Good Faith Estimate.  Last minute changes and fees are not your problem, they're ours â€“ period.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is the best way to get started?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Simply <a href="/apply">Apply Now</a> and find the loan program that's right for you. Complete the application online or call one of our non-commissioned loan consultants at <PhoneLink /> to walk you through the process. It's that easy.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What if I don't like the idea of giving my personal financial information online?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Rate Rabbit provides an encrypted, secure site so you can be sure that your information is not being exposed. We also never, ever, sell, rent or give away your personal information to any third party that is not connected to the loan process. In fact, we have one of the best privacy policy in the lending industry. But we understand, if you prefer to get us your documentation a different way, we would be more than happy to take that way. Just talk to your Loan Consultant for more information.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Is it really a better value to go with the one fixed-fee instead of getting my own vendors?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Rate Rabbit has negotiated with the best third-party vendors in the business to get the best fees for your refinance possible.  These vendors give Rate Rabbit their best prices because we give them a consistent, high-volume amount of business. It's that simple.

    <h3>
      What Should I do to prepare for my loan?
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the point that you Apply with us, begin to gather documentation that will help us to quickly process your loan. These documents include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pay Stubs for the last 30 days
      </li>
      <li>
        W-2 forms for the last 2 years
      </li>
      <li>
        Bank Statements or other documents that will verify where the down payment and closing costs will be paid from for  Purchase Transactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prior two years of Tax Returns
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You should also prepare your home for the appraisal if you are going to Refinance your home.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What Documentation do I need?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pay Stubs for the last 30 days
      </li>
      <li>
        W-2 forms for the last 2 years
      </li>
      <li>
        Bank Statements or other documents that will verify where the down payment and closing costs will be paid from for Purchase Transactions.

      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Why is the Appraisal important?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The appraisal is done to determine the value of the home you will be purchasing or refinancing. This value is used to determine eligibility for certain programs. It will also help to avoid you paying too much for a home that is not currently worth the price it is selling for. If you are refinancing, the appraisal will determine the amount of cash you can take out for updating your home. This report is very important and can affect your loan.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Can I hire an appraiser of my choosing?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fannie Mae place an Appraiser Independence Requirement (AIR) and has very specific guidelines to ensure the inspection and the value are completely unbiased. For that reason, an appraisal must be ordered following those guidelines.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What should I do to prepare for the appraisal?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because your appraisal is so important, it is always best to prepare your home before the inspection. Below are some basic items to consider before your inspection. If you are unsure, please contact your Loan Consultant and they will be happy to help you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Should I pay Points?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Points are a way to lower your interest rate. Each point is equal to 1% of your mortgage amount. Because everyone has different goals and needs, it is best to discuss points with your Loan Consultant. They will help to determine if you should consider paying points or not and will make sure that your decision is in line with your specific goals.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How Will I know if the rates are low enough to Refinance?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We offer you the ability to get notifications when the rate drops below a certain point. Simply sign up for our Rate Notification program and let us keep track of it for you. Once the rates drop to the level you desire, we will contact you via email. At that point, you just need to <a href="/apply">Apply</a> for the rate of your choice or call us at <PhoneLink /> to speak to one of our Loan Consultants. Yes, it's that simple.
